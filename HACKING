Howdy, Hacker!

So, we have a few ground rules with Syn. Most of them make sense,
some might not make as much sense, but they're all for a good reason.

If you follow these rules, you'll not only make us (the AUTHORS) very happy,
but you'll be more likely to get features you ask for :)

 1) We use tabs. Yes I know it's funny to use tabs in Python, but hold on a sec,
    there's a good reason. Some of the reasons are borderline silly, but here
    they are. Seriously, give this a think:

      * You need only hit one key to indent each level, rather then four
        or eight.

      * You can set your tab width to however many spaces you think is
        best -- after all, some of us like 4, others like 8, and some poor
        poor souls like 2.

      * Over a very very very large project, the memory saved by using one
        tab char per line is much less then 4 or 8 per. We know this is a 
        silly reason, but it's a nice way to rationalize it.

 2) Use `Syn.policy` for any constants you might need in more then one
    module.

 3) Please __doc__ all your functions. We have some cool flags you can use
    in the __doc__ string:

       * @arg foo: descr
       * @return:  descr
       * @warning: descr

    These are also subject to change with no notice.

 4) Is the code you've written as clean as it could be, absolutely? If not,
    why not?

 5) Please add lots of (meaningful) comments.

 6) Have a goddamn sense of humor.
