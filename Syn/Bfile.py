 This handles reads and writes to gzip compressed files, if the files
 are large, or if you know there'll be a bunch of them. It sucks for small
 files, or files you want to maintain deltas against.

 Usage:

 ```
 import Syn.Bfile

 fd = Syn.Bfile.Bfile("./binary-file")
 fd.setContent("Hello, World!")
 fd.write()
 ```
"""

import Syn.Log as l
